### David, Michelangelo

I know it’s extremely cliché, but Michelangelo’s David always comes to mind as one of my favorite masterpeices. Housed at the far center of Galleria dell’Accademia in Firenze, Italy, David’s in-person magnificence strikes me to this day as one of the most memorable experiences I had abroad. Lofted about 4 feet above ground level, David’s realness is tragically experienced as the viewer walks around the base of the larger-than-life statue.

Created from a single block of initially rejected marble, each part of David: the hair, hands/feet, muscle tone, veins, and stature is lifelike. I also think of the significance of the biblical story of David and “Goliath”, in which David kills Goliath with only a sling and stone, which is carved here in his hands, ironically in stone.

### CLOUD, Caitlind r.c. Brown and Wayne Garrett

This installation by Canadian artists Caitlind r.c. Brown and Wayne Garrett is composed of 6,000 donated incandescent lightbulbs. From afar, the piece looks like a stormcloud with rain pouring out of it, but is really 6,000 lightbulbs formed together with chains hanging down that control the on/off of the lights. The ability for viewers to physically interact with the piece creates an enveloping and experiential environment. Lights switching on and off in the work create the imagery of a lightening storm.
